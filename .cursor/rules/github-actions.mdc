# GitHub Actions Guidelines

## Security Best Practices

- **Always use commit hashes for GitHub Actions** instead of version tags
  - This prevents supply chain attacks by ensuring we're using exact versions
  - Include the version tag as a comment for reference
  - Example: `uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4`

## Version Management

- Keep actions up to date with their latest stable versions
- Use caching where appropriate to speed up workflows
- Follow security best practices for GitHub Actions

## Version Checking Commands

Use these commands to find latest versions:

```bash
# For GitHub-hosted projects
gh release list --repo <owner>/<repo> --limit 1

# For GitHub Actions specifically
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest

# For GitHub Actions versions
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/tags
```

## Best Practices

- Never guess or use potentially outdated versions
- Always verify versions from official repositories
- Keep GitHub Actions and their versions up to date
- Use commit hashes for GitHub Actions instead of version tags
- Include version tags as comments for reference

Example format:
```yaml
uses: owner/repo@commit_hash # v1.2.3
```
