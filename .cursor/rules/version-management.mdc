# Version Management Best Practices

## General Principles

- Always check for the latest versions of dependencies and GitHub Actions
- Never guess or use potentially outdated versions
- Always verify versions from official repositories
- Keep GitHub Actions and their versions up to date

## Version Checking Commands

Use the following commands to find latest versions:

```bash
# For GitHub-hosted projects
gh release list --repo <owner>/<repo> --limit 1

# For GitHub Actions specifically
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest

# For GitHub Actions versions
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/tags
```

## Dependency Management

- Use uv to manage Python dependencies
- Keep `pyproject.toml` up to date with version constraints
- Regularly update dependencies to latest compatible versions
- Use dependency scanning tools when available
- Document version requirements clearly

## Security Considerations

- Use commit hashes for GitHub Actions instead of version tags
- Include version tags as comments for reference
- Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Keep all tooling and dependencies updated
